# Snatch
### 📥 AI OSINT - Capture, download, and enjoy.

**Snatch** is a versatile tool crafted for cybersecurity and hacking enthusiasts. Developed in Python and currently in active development, **Snatch** aims to serve as a powerful multipurpose tool for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tasks, leveraging Artificial Intelligence to enhance task efficiency and speed.

Imagine simply inputting a prompt that details all relevant information about your target. **Snatch** then autonomously generates potential password lists, identifies possible emails and social networks, and more.

Alternatively, you can directly execute commands via your terminal to utilize **Snatch**.

It's important to emphasize that **Snatch** is a work in progress, and all operations are conducted locally. Users should exercise caution as they assume full responsibility for their actions.
